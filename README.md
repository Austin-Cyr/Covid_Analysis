# Covid_Analysis
Capstone Project for Vanderbilt Data Boot Camp

## Description of project 
With Covid being at the forefornt of discussion for what feels like an eternity, we are now to the point where many individuals are wanting to branch out from the safety of their home to explore the world. Although a lot of process as been made since the global pandemic first began, there is still a lot of uncertanity. Many states are seeing great progress, while others are not. There are many factors that play into cases going up or down, i.e. masks and vaccines, hoewever many people are not aware of their states case number and the risks that one is taking when stepping out side. This can lead to an uptick in cases. With the creation of a Covid Risk Calculater, our goal as a team is to help individuals weigh the risks of going out in public. With this calculator we hope to help individuals understand Covid numbers better. By understanding you're states number, you can make positive choices that will impact not only your community, but the global community.

## Communication protocols
With any group work communication is key. It is very important that all group members understand their role within the group. When starting a group project the end result can be daunting and team members can feel anxious. With proper communication these feeling of anxeity can be eased. By each person knowing and completing their role, the end result will be easier to reach. Our main method of communication will be through Slack. By using Slack we are easily able to instant message everyone at the same time. This ensures that no one is left out of what is being dicussed. As a back up, all group members have each other cell phone number incase their is an emergency and something needs to be addressed fast.

## Creation of Branches
Along with cleaning of data, the creation of Branches is a crucial part of the project. Branches allow you to develop features, fix bugs, or safely experiment with new ideas in a contained area of your repository.

## First things first
Before diving too deep into the project itself, first the data needed to be discovered and then cleaned. Through out the past year and half+, data for Covid has been collected, to our surprise in great and detailed numbers. Almost all state-counties-states, but not all, have reported data on the cases, hospitalization rates and vaccine numbers. 

## Use of Google Data Studio
We intend to use Google Data Studio to showcase work.
