# Covid_Analysis
Capstone Project for Vanderbilt Data Boot Camp

# Description of project (rough draft)
With Covid being at the forefornt of discussion for what feels like an eternity, we are now to the point where many individuals are wanting to branch out from the safety of their home to explore the world. Although a lot of process as been made since the global pandemic first began, there is still a lot of uncertanity. Many states are seeing great progress, while others are not. There are many factors that play into cases going up or down, i.e. masks and vaccine, hoewever many people are not aware of their States cases number and the risks that one is taking when stepping out side. This can lead to an uptick in cases. With the creation of a Covid Risk Calculater, our goal as a team is to help individuals weigh the risks of going out in public. With this calculator we hope to help individuals understand Covid numbers better. By understanding you're states number, you can make positive choices that will impact not only your community, but your enitre state and beyond.

# Group details and communication protocols
With any group work communication is key. It is very important that all group member understand their role within the group. When starting a group task the end result can be daunting and team members can feel anxious. With proper communication these feeling of anxeity can be eased. By each person knowing and completing their role, the end result will be easier to reach. Our main method of communication will be through Slack. By using using we are easily able to instant message not just each other important information and links, but everyone at the same time. This ensures that no one is left out of what is being dicussed. As a back up, all group members have each other cell phone number incase their is an emergency and something needs to be addressed fast.
